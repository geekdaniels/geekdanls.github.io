            <img id="imga" src="img/img.jpg" alt="hello"/>
           <p id="top">Surveys are interesting but don't bet your career on them. If you take nothing else from this article, remember:</p>
            
            <blockquote><q>Those who pick a language based on survey data or monetary prospects will fall</q></blockquote>
            
            <p>There's one secret to becoming a great developer</p>
            
            <blockquote><q>Just build stuffs</q></blockquote>
            
            <p>First, find a problem - especially one which has a personal interest or benefit to you. Perhaps that's creating a resume website, organising your finances, automating your home or sending random tweets to your followers.  Ensure the goals are achievable, even the best developers would shudder at the thought of creating a WordPress or Call of Duty clone</p>
            
            <p>Now choose  an appropriate set of technologies. There may be several options but don't attempt to force a language on the solution. You may be able to create a native mobile app in perl but resources are rare and it'll be a frustrating excercise.</p>
            
            <p>Then create your solution. Google code examples and fellow developers are helpful but don't expect them to provide all the answers. Your project is (or should be) unique and only one person can teach you to program.  YOU! </p>
            
            <p>Finally, don't expect to become a coding ninja overnight. Some people have a natural aptitude but they also spent many hours honing their skills and are continually learning new technoloies and techniques. Even the most junior roles presume several years development experience.  If you find you need a hand along the way, there are plenty of online resources that can help.</p>
            
            <p>In summary, choosing a language to learn for the sake of it is a boring academic exercise. Few people succeed. It's better to learn a language which helps you solve a real problem. Don't worry if that technology is obsolete or outside the top ten - all languages are coceptually similar and your skills are transferable.</p>
           
            
            <div class="sec">
               <header class="titleblog"> An Art! </header>
            <p>Programming is a passion. It requires a combination of logical thinking, experience, creativity, imagination and curiosity.  Some people are naturally adapt, but there are no short-cuts. It takes considerable time to ahieve a resonable level of competence, and you never stop learning. After all that, be prepared to give up the obselete technologies you spent years crafting.</p>
               
               <p>Before you embark on preparation for a career in software development, ask yourself a single question:
               </p>
               
               <blockquote><q>Would I write programs in my spare time for enjoyment?</q></blockquote>
                
                <img class="img4" src="img/img4.jpg"/>
               
               <p>Be honest. Only one person can motivate you. Only one person can teach you to program. Only one person can devote the time, energy and costs required to learn the skills. If you are not prepared to make the investments. no one else will - so pick a career which interests you more or requires less effort.</p>
               
               <p>Choosing a single technology based on surveys, salaries or the opinion of others will also fail. Complete your own small developments tasks and expose yourself to as many languages, tools and technologies as possible. Examine code and discuss it with your peers. That knowledge becomes invaluable as you progress to increasingly complex projects. </p>
               
               <p>You may reach a point where someone will pay handsomely for your expertise, but don't depend on it.
            Being paid for something you enjoy is a bnus. If you don't enjoy programming, it will become a chore, and no monetary reward will make you happy.</p>
               
               <p>What are you waiting for? Think of a problem and code a solution. You may pick a troblesome technology, but it's the experience that matters - not the language.</p>
